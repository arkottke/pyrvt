!spectral shape: source number, pf_a, pd_a, pf_b, pd_b
! where source number means:

!  2 = Joyner (BSSA 74, 1167--1188)
!  3 = Atkinson (BSSA 83, 1778--1798; see also Atkinson & Boore, BSSA 85,

!  4 = Atkinson & Silva (BSSA 87, 97--113)
!  5 = Haddon 1996 (approximate spectra in Fig. 10 of
!          Haddon's paper in BSSA 86, 1300--1313;
!          see also Atkinson & Boore, BSSA 88, 917--934)
!  6 = AB98-California (Atkinson & Boore BSSA 88, 917--934)
!  7 = Boatwright & Choy (this is the functional form used by
!                         Boore & Atkinson, BSSA 79, 1736--1761, p. 1761)
!  8 = Joyner (his ENA two-corner model, done for the SSHAC elicitation
!      workshop)
!  9 = Atkinson & Silva (BSSA 90, 255--274)
! 10 = Atkinson (2005 model),
! 11 = Generalized multiplicative two-corner model
!      (S = [1/(1+(f/fa)**pf_a)**pd_a]*[1/(1+(f/fb)**pf_b)**pd_b])
! 12 = Generalized additive two-corner model
!      (S = (1-eps)/(1+(f/fa)**pf_a)**pd_a] + eps/(1+(f/fb)**pf_b)**pd_b)
!          NOTE: if M<M for eps = 1.0, the program uses eps = 1, and the source spectrum only depends
!          on fb, which is equal to the corner frequency of the single-corner source model.
!          One warning: the source duration is given by a weighted average of 1/fa and 1/fb, as
!          specified below.   For eps = 1.0 fa will be set equal to fc (the corner frequency for the
!          single-corner frequency with the specified stress parameter).   This will probably result in a
!          a discontinuity in fa for eps = 1.0 and for eps slightly larger than 1.0.  This may affect the
!          computation of duration.  Note that if the weights of 0.5 and 0.0 for 1/fa and 1/fb used by Atkinson and Boore (1995)
!          and Atkinson and Silva (2000) are specified, then the source duration for M smaller than the M for eps = 1.0
!          will be 0.5/fa, whereas it more logically should be 1/fc = 1/fa.  This is a general problem with
!          the source duration of the two-corner model if the AB95 and AS00 weights are used.  Because
!          M for eps =1.0 is usually small, the inconsistency will probably only arise for small magnitudes,
!          for which the source duration will be small compared to the path duration.  But the
!          way to avoid an inconsistency in the source duration is to use weights of 0.5 and 0.5 for 1/fa and 1/fb, respectively.
!          For large M, fb will usually be much larger than fa, and the
!          source duration will be dominated by 0.5/fa.   For this reason, I am revising my recommendations
!          for the source duration weights below.
! pf_a, pd_a, pf_b, pd_a are used for source numbers 1, 11, and 12, usually
! subject to these constraints for an omega-squared spectrum:
! source 1: pf_a*pd_a = 2
! source 11: pf_a*pd_a + pf_b*pd_b = 2
! source 12: pf_a*pd_a = pf_b*pd_b = 2
! The usual single-corner frequency model uses
! pf_a=2.0,pd_a=1.0; the Butterworth filter shape is given by
! pf_a=4.0,pd_a=0.5.  pf_b and pd_b are only used by sources 11 and 12, but dummy
! values must be included for all sources.

!     source 12, as given by the equation log eps = c1_eps + c2_eps*(M-amagc4eps).
!   fb for sources 11 and 12 are given such that the high-frequency spectral level

!source duration: weights of 1/fa, 1/fb
! Previous to 03/25/13, I recommended that the weights for source 1 be 1.0 0.0, and
! for the Atkinson and colleagues 2-corner sources be 0.5 0.0.  But since dursource is always computed as w_fa/fa + w_fb/fb, and because
! fb is set equal to fa for source 1, even though fb is not used in spect_shape, using weights of 0.5 and 0.5
! for source 1 will give the same answer as the previously recommended 1.0 0.0 weights.  The advantage
! to using weights of 0.5 0.5 is that they are the same as I am now recommending for the Atkinson and colleagues (and perhaps
! all) 2-corner models, for reasons discussed in the spectral shape, source 12
! section above.  This is not what is used by Atkinson and colleagues; they use 0.5 0.0 for the weights
! (Atkinson and Boore (1995, p. 20) and Atkinson and Silva (2000, p. 259)).
