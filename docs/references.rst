Historical Development
----------------------

The development of random vibration theory for earthquake engineering applications spans several decades:

**1960s-1970s**: Foundation period
   - Development of basic RVT concepts
   - Early applications to earthquake engineering
   - Vanmarcke's seminal work on first-passage times

**1980s-1990s**: Practical applications
   - Integration with ground motion prediction
   - Development of stochastic simulation methods
   - Refinement of peak factor calculations

**2000s-2010s**: Modern implementations
   - Computational advances enabling broader application
   - Integration with probabilistic seismic hazard analysis
   - Development of more sophisticated source models

**2010s-Present**: Current research
   - Machine learning applications
   - Site-specific ground motion prediction
   - Integration with physics-based simulations

Contributing References
-----------------------

If you know of additional references that should be included in pyRVT documentation:

1. Create an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/arkottke/pyrvt/issues>`_ with the reference details
2. Consider contributing a pull request adding the reference to ``refs.bib``
3. Provide context about how the reference relates to pyRVT functionality

Reference Management
--------------------

The bibliography is managed using:

- **BibTeX format** in the ``refs.bib`` file
- **sphinxcontrib-bibtex** for automatic bibliography generation
- **Zotero** for reference management (optional)

All references in the documentation should be included in the centralized bibliography
to ensure consistency and proper formatting.
