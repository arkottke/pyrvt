Overview
--------

The User Guide is organized into several sections:

**Tutorials**
   Step-by-step guides covering the main features and concepts of pyRVT.
   These tutorials build on each other and provide a comprehensive learning path.

**Examples**
   Real-world examples and use cases showing how to apply pyRVT to solve
   practical problems in earthquake engineering and seismology.

**Command-Line Interface**
   Complete guide to using pyRVT's command-line tools for batch processing
   and automation.

Topics Covered
--------------

The tutorials and examples cover:

- **Basic RVT concepts**: Understanding the relationship between Fourier amplitude spectra and response spectra
- **Peak factor models**: Comparing different peak factor formulations and their applications
- **Ground motion models**: Using seismological models to generate synthetic ground motions
- **Data processing**: Working with real earthquake data and file formats
- **Advanced techniques**: Customizing calculations and extending pyRVT functionality

Before You Start
----------------

Make sure you have:

1. **Installed pyRVT** following the :doc:`../getting-started/installation` guide
2. **Basic Python knowledge** including NumPy and Matplotlib
3. **Understanding of earthquake engineering concepts** (helpful but not required)

If you're new to pyRVT, start with the :doc:`../getting-started/quickstart` guide first.
