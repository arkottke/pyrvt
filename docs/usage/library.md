# Use as a library

The intent in developing `pyRVT` the was for use in site response calculations
performed by [pyStrata](https://github.com/arkottke/pystrata). However, it can
also be used for independent calculations through [peak calculation](#peak-calculators) or through [ground motion models](#ground-motion-models).
